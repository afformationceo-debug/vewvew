      "First time doing medical tourism and I chose this package based on the reviews. Was not disappointed at all! Dr. Kim carefully mapped out my face and used Juvederm to enhance my cheeks and lips. The results are subtle but beautiful. The Garosu-gil food tour was a highlight - tasted amazing Korean BBQ and visited the cutest cafes. The InterContinental was luxurious. The whole experience felt like a holiday with a beauty bonus!",

      "After 25 years of wearing glasses, I finally went for LASIK at Seoul Eye Center. The pre-op examination was incredibly thorough - they tested everything. The surgery itself was barely 15 minutes, and by the next morning I could see clearly! The JW Marriott was a perfect base, and the palace tour was gorgeous. Wearing a hanbok at Gyeongbokgung without worrying about glasses falling off was such a liberating feeling. Dr. Shin is a genius. Thank you K-MEDI TOUR!",

The staff are efficient, the equipment is cutting-edge, and the results are delivered in Chinese. This year's Seoul city tour was wonderful - the Cheonggyecheon Stream walk was peaceful and Insadong was full of interesting traditional shops. The Shilla Hotel was magnificent. Highly recommended for anyone from China looking for premium health screening.",

Only 4 stars because I wish the package included more meals, but the treatment and experience were excellent.",

The 3D simulation before surgery matched the final result almost exactly. The K-drama filming location tour was amusing, and Lotte World was fun once I was feeling better. The InterContinental Club room was excellent with great afternoon tea service. Seven days was the ideal recovery timeframe. Merci beaucoup, K-MEDI TOUR!",

Dr. Lee was knowledgeable and the aftercare kit was thoughtful. However, the Lotte Hotel location in Myeongdong was quite noisy at night, and the cultural tour felt a bit rushed. I would have preferred more time at each stop. The treatment results are good, but the overall experience could be improved. Still better value than getting similar treatments in the US.",

      "Dr. Han did a great job on my double eyelid surgery - the shape is exactly what I wanted. However, the swelling lasted about 10 days, which was longer than the 5-7 days mentioned. This meant I couldn't fully enjoy the K-Pop tour as I still had visible bruising. The Courtyard Marriott was comfortable and the staff were accommodating. I think the package should be extended to 7 days for this type of surgery. The result at 3 months is beautiful though, so I can't complain too much.",
